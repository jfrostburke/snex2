Welcome to the project page for SNEx 2.0, an updated version of the [Supernova Exchange]("https://supernova.exchange") built using the [TOM Toolkit]("https://tomtoolkit.github.io/"). To build your own TOM (Target Observation Manager), check out the [getting started guide]("https://tomtoolkit.github.io/docs/getting_started").

The Supernova Exchange (2.0) is an interface for viewing and sharing observational
data of supernovae, and for requesting and managing observations
with the [LCO]("https://lco.global/") network.

SNEx 2.0 is currently live at [test.supernova.exchange]("https://test.supernova.exchange/"). Most pages are private (proprietary data), but the "TNS Targets" page is public.
